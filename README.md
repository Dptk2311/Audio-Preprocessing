# Audio-Preprocessing
This notebook provides a robust introduction to audio data preprocessing, with practical examples of feature extraction and visualization. 

In this notebook, we have explored the fundamental steps involved in audio preprocessing using Python and libraries like Librosa. The key objectives and techniques covered include:

## Audio Loading and Preprocessing:

We loaded audio files into Python using Librosa and ensured proper handling of mono and stereo formats.

We explored techniques like downsampling and upsampling to adjust the audio sample rate to appropriate levels for analysis.

## Feature Extraction:

We demonstrated various feature extraction techniques, such as:

**Waveform Visualization:** We visualized both mono and stereo waveforms, gaining insight into the amplitude of sound over time.

**Spectrograms:** We explored the frequency content of the audio using STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform), and examined the energy distribution across both frequency and time.

**Mel Spectrogram:** Using the Mel scale, we visualized the audio's frequency content in a way that mimics human hearing, which is commonly used for speech and music analysis.

**MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):** We extracted and visualized MFCCs, which are powerful features for audio classification and speech recognition tasks.

## Practical Applications:

These preprocessing steps lay the foundation for more advanced tasks like audio classification, speech recognition, and sound analysis.

By converting raw audio into meaningful features (e.g., MFCCs, Mel spectrogram), we can build machine learning models that can classify sounds, recognize speech, or even generate audio content.
